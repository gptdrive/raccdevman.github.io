# ChatDrive User Data Deletion Policy

At present, **ChatDrive**, our application, does not support user registration and therefore does not collect or store any personally identifiable information (PII), such as names, email addresses, or other personal details. 

The sole purpose of the login functionality in our application is to facilitate the import of chat data from Google Drive via the Google Drive API. We assure you that this process is conducted with your privacy in mind, and does not involve us accessing, collecting, or storing any of your personal data.

Consequently, as we do not collect or store any user data, there is currently no mechanism for data deletion within our application. 

## Future Policy for Data Deletion

In future updates, if we were to introduce a user registration feature, we want to assure you that an account deletion function will be implemented concurrently. This function will allow users to delete all their account information from our servers, maintaining their control over their data and privacy.

Upon implementation of such features, users wishing to delete their account can do so by sending a deletion request to `raccoon.devlab@gmail.com`. Upon receipt of this request, we will promptly assist in the deletion of the user's account. 

## Commitment to Privacy

Our priority is the privacy and security of our users. We will maintain a high standard in handling your data. All future changes to our data collection, storage, or processing policies will be communicated transparently through updates to this document.

We assure you that our commitment to your privacy is of utmost importance to us and we will always respect your rights in this regard.
