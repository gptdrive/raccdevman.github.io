# ChatDrive Usage Guide

ChatDrive is an application that allows users to save and manage their AI chat conversations, which they've had using platforms like Bard, ChatGPT, etc. This tool has both a Chrome extension and an Android application.

## Step 1: Install Required Software
First, download and install the ChatDrive Chrome extension and Android application.

## Step 2: Interact and Save Conversations

# Note
ChatDrive currently only supports Chrome. Thus, for services like BingChat that only function in Bing, you would have to use a third-party tool that allows BingChat to operate in Chrome.
