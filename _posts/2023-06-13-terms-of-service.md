# ChatDrive App - Terms of Service

These Terms and Conditions of Use (the "Terms") and any dispute or claim arising out of or in connection with them or their subject matter (including non-contractual disputes or claims) shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the jurisdiction in which your app is based.

## Summary

These Terms apply whenever you use the ChatDrive app.

**IF YOU DO NOT ACCEPT AND AGREE TO THESE TERMS THEN YOU MUST NOT ACCESS OR USE CHATDRIVE.**

## Privacy and Data Collection

We value your privacy. ChatDrive does not collect or store any personal data as we directly transfer data from your Google Drive to the ChatDrive app through the Google Drive API. This means we do not have access to your personal data, unless you choose to share it with us.

In the future, we plan to enable a ChatBoard function. Only conversation records posted directly by customers for public purposes will be stored on our servers. We will update our policy accordingly prior to enabling this feature.

## Content

Please note that posts created by AI are not copyrighted. As a user of ChatDrive, you maintain ownership of any content that you save using our app, provided you were the original rightful owner of that content.

## Future Content Guidelines

When the ChatBoard function is enabled in the future, the following guidelines should be adhered to for any content you choose to make public:

- Avoid content that contains offensive language or is likely to harass, upset, embarrass, alarm or annoy any other person;
- Avoid content that is obscene, pornographic, or otherwise may offend human dignity;
- Do not encourage any illegal activity;
- Do not post defamatory content;
- Respect all third partyâ€™s rights, including, without limitation, intellectual property rights and privacy rights.

## Limitation of liability

You expressly agree that the use of ChatDrive is at your sole risk. ChatDrive is provided on an "as is" basis and we make no warranties, expressed or implied, and disclaim any implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose and non-infringement.

## Indemnity

If we are sued as a result of your use of ChatDrive then we have the right to defend or settle the relevant claim as we see fit. If we ask, you will co-operate fully and reasonably as required by us in the defence of any relevant claim.
