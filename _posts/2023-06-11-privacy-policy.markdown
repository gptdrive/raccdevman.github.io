# ChatDrive - Privacy Policy

This Privacy Policy outlines our commitment to protecting your privacy and sets forth our practices related to the use and safeguarding of information you provide while using the ChatDrive app.

## Respect for Your Privacy

We value your privacy and are committed to safeguarding it. Our current framework adheres to best practices and applicable laws. At this time, the app collects minimal personal data - your email, id-token, and profile information. However, we do not have access to this data or use it beyond the requirements of the application's functionality.

## Future Updates and Your Responsibility

We are continuously working to enhance your experience with our app. As part of future updates, we might introduce a bulletin board feature, providing a platform for users to post information. If and when this feature is enabled, you will bear responsibility for any personal information you choose to share. Therefore, we urge you to exercise caution and discernment when posting data.

## Compliance with Privacy Standards and Laws

In alignment with global privacy standards and regulations, we pledge to handle any potential future collection of personal data responsibly and transparently. Prior to launching any feature that could result in such collection, we will update this policy to reflect the changes and ensure you stay informed about how we manage and protect your information.

For any questions or concerns regarding this privacy policy, please feel free to contact us. We remain committed to maintaining a secure and trustworthy environment for our users.
